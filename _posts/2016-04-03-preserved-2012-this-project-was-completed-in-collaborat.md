Preserved -  2012 - This project was completed in collaboration with Fourfold Farm, a biodynamic farm north of Guelph, Ontario. Thank you to Whitestone Gallery, the Ontario Arts Council, 10 Carden Street and the Guelph Public library for exhibition support.

The books I buried were the Life Science library from the 1960's.Treating these books as future archaeological artifacts, they were wrapped in canvas or foil and dipped in bees wax to create a sealed book. The wax dipped books become both a curiosity, a reminder of processes of domestic preservation (canning, root cellars, planting), and also a new artifact, sitting on the cusp of preservation and decay.

The idea of burying books seems counter intuitive to keeping information alive. Yet, consider things stored and preserved in the ground: seeds; food in root cellars; water in cisterns and wells. Burial can be preservation instead of decomposition. These wax dipped books are purposefully made anachronistic artifact of the future.The insufficiency of the preservation method speaks to the fragility of knowledge preservation. 

The question of how to safeguard cultural and scientific knowledge is a focal point for contemporary library, science and cultural conservators.
